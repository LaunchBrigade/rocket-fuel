Description

Super-powered WordPress parent theme for developers.

Outline

+ Hooks, hooks, hooks.
+ HTML5 structure
+ Breadcrumbs
+ Threaded comments
+ Pagination
+ No styles, empty stylesheet.
+ No admin settings.
+ No huge blocks of code in functions.php.
  + seperated out into library folder.

NOTE: Justin Tadlock (Creator of Hybrid Core/Hybrid) has created a new HTML5 parent theme, Hybrid Base. Looking at that for inspiration. So far, not seeing any hooks though.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
